            <h3>Handwashing: The family in action</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/wash-hands.png" alt="A photo showing how to wash hands properly">
            <br>
            <p>Handwashing is very essential in our daily routine. It's cheap, easy, and effective to get rid of the virus, bacteria, and germs that cause diseases like cold, flu, or diarrhea. Handwashing keeps us healthy so that we can continue with our daily life like going to school or work.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Help your child develop handwashing skills</h4>
            <p>Parents and guardians play an important role in teaching kids the proper way of handwashing most especially in our daily routine. The key to maintaining a lifelong habit is by doing it every day at an early age. Teach them how to properly wash their hands and when to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Frecuent reminder</h4>
            <p>Your child will need to be reminded regularly when and how to wash their hands, so it takes time to build a habit. Once it becomes a habit, it will be part of their lives forever. It's very important to remind them to wash their hands after using the bathroom, before eating, after playing outside, after coughing or sneezing, before manipulating foods when cooking, after playing with pets, before playing with babies, and every time we see our hands dirty. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Lead by example</h4>
            <p>Children learn by imitating others. Set an example by washing your hands for them to follow.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Best practice</h4>
            <p>The best way to keep your hands clean is to wash them with water and soap. But if these two are not available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Just remember to wash your hands with water and soap as soon as you can.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Remember HANDWASHING is a lifetime habit to keep us healthy and clean at school, in the house, or in the playground!</h4>
