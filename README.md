# ONLINE COOKING CLASSES
Online cooking class for the whole family, especially for the kids. It's healthy, free, fun, and friendly.

## INTRODUCTION
__KIDS *first*__ offer healthy online cooking classes aimed to teach basic cooking techniques to the little ones at home and of course to the whole family as well.

Cooking is an art. It's a daily house choir that can be learned by doing. Teaching the art of cooking from an early age with the help of these online cooking classes can promote creativity, a healthy and nutritious diet, cleanliness, self-confidence, and all other good benefits that cooking can bring to the whole family, especially to the kids in the house.

Good family bonding can be achieved by implicating everyone to do something and finish them happily to create happy memories. But sometimes parents are so loaded with work and stuff that family bonding and sometimes family gathering is forgotten. So __KIDS *first*__ is designed online to unite everyone in the house without going outside. It’s also free of charge so parents don’t need to worry about monthly payments or maintenance. The only penny you need to spend is in buying good kitchen tools for the children’s safety and all the healthy ingredients of the recipes we send via email prior to the cooking classes.

Cooking in our very own cozy little kitchen all together with our kids, helping each other to finish a nice good meal, and also cooking and sharing tips with other families from their own kitchen is fun, beneficial, and healthy. It’s the best way to spend time with the family and to enjoy a nice healthy meal created by everyone.
