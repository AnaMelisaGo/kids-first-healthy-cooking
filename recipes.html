                        Using the different colors of food is an effective method to prepare a balanced menu and to
                        prepare cheerful and appetizing dishes for the little ones. The color is not only to make the
                        dishes more attractive but also reveals important nutritional characteristics of the food,
                        especially in the case of fruits and vegetables. For example, red is antioxidant; orange
                        protects from ultraviolet rays and improves vision; green protects against the risk of heart
                        attack and purple improves circulation; yellow protects the eyes from any kind of disease.

                    properties. They are very rich in vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium,
                    in addition to being one of the vegetables with the highest iron content. They are very essential
                    for anemia, physical or mental fatigue. Pediatricians and nutritionists advise introducing them from

                        With this technique, the food is cooked in its own juice, so that the mineral salts remain
                        practically intact, as long as the cooking juice is consumed, fewer vitamins are lost than with
                        other techniques. This way of cooking can be applied to fish and vegetables, like potatoes.

                        Fish is a very rich source of noble proteins, compared to meat, and it is also rich in useful
                        minerals, such as phosphorus and iodine, a very important element for the functioning of the
                        thyroid gland and for your child's growth. Fish meat is digestive, tender, can be chewed easily,
                        and contains less fat than meat, and they are also of better quality! Some of the most suitable
                        fish for children are grouper, sole, sea bass, trout, hake, or sea bream. They are all healthy
                        and lean.

                        <li>Heat the milk without boiling it. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Peel the onion and mince it as small as possible. Put olive oil on a saucepan and fry the
                            onions until light brown.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the flour and toast for 3 or 4 minutes. Stir once in a while. This step is very
                            important so that the croquettes do not taste like raw flour.</li>
                        <li>Pour at once the heated milk. Do not stop stirring until the mixture is thickened. Add the
                            minced ham and mix well.</li>
                        <li>Put the dough into a container and let it cool to easily form the croquettes.</li>
                        <li>On a plate put quite a lot of breadcrumbs, and beat the three eggs in a bowl.</li>
                        <li>Once it's cooled down, shape the croquettes with the help of two spoons. Put it through the
                            breadcrumbs, dip it on the eggs, and again through the breadcrumbs. Finish shaping it with
                            your hands. Put them on a plate.</li>
                        <li>The secret of frying the croquettes is frying them on a very hot vegetable cooking oil, for
                            lesser oil, crispier on the outside, and creamier on the inside. Fry them four by four so
                            that it's equally cooked and the oil does not get cold.</li>
                        <li>Once they turn into golden brown, it is ready to be served. Enjoy!</li>
